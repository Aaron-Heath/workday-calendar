# Workday Calendar
## Description
This application allows the user to store and review their events in a given day. Between regular business hours (9am-5pm), the user can store information about events that occurs in each time block. For user convenience, time blocks are highlighted different colors relative to the current time: grey for past events, green for upcoming, and red for current events.

The application will validate user input to ensure that it conforms to the variable types and parameters outlined in the prompts provided to the user.
